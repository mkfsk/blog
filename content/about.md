Iâ€™m a non-computer science major who is making progress to become a data scientist.  
I do not have professional knowledge about computer science or data science.  
However, I always love to learn about new technology and experience them.  

My goals of the blog are:

- Hold myself accountable
- Reinforce learning
- Meet new people

Although I created this site for myself, someone may find it beneficial; therefore, I share my journey to become a data scientist with everyone.
